My name is Meng, and I am a postgraduate student in computer science at Fudan University, working under the guidance of [Kai Zhang](https://kay21s.github.io/) in the [DASLab](https://daslab.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm), led by [X. Sean Wang](https://daslab.fudan.edu.cn/61/83/c26852a287107/page.htm). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Big Data Technologies from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). My research journey began during my third year as an undergraduate, under the mentorship of [Ting Bai](https://tbbaby.github.io/baiting_index.html), whose guidance I value greatly.

Currently, I am a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia, mentored by [Baotong Lu](https://baotonglu.github.io/). I am actively seeking a PhD position for Fall 2025.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
