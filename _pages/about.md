I'm Meng, a postgraduate student majoring in computer science, advised by [Kai Zhang](https://kay21s.github.io/) at [DASLab](https://daslab.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm) led by [X.Sean Wang](https://daslab.fudan.edu.cn/61/83/c26852a287107/page.htm), Fudan University. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in data science and big data technologies from BUPT.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
